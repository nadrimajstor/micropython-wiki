###Status###
Initial port completed with same feature as PyBoard with following exceptions:
* Only 1 LED is available (later update combined with HydraNFC Shield, 4 LEDs will be available).
* No accelerometer (but can be mounted on a breadboard or by doing a custom board see CC BY-SA 4.0 open hardware extension template for HydraBus: https://github.com/bvernoux/hydrabus/tree/master/hardware/HydraBus_1_0_Shield_Template_Rev0)
